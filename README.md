# California-SAT
Used data manipulation and visualization to find the county in California with the best average SAT scores by using SQLite and Python. I was able to extract the necessary data that I needed in order to find out which county in Califonia has the best SAT test-takers during a specific testing season. After obtaining this data I statistically modeled it in a clear and concise way where viewers can see which county might have a better secondary school/high school system compared to one another. I created the statistic model by using NumPy and matplotlib.
